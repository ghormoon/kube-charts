# kube-charts

Various little charts i needed for my deployment. I'm using [ReSearchITEng/kubeadm-playbook](https://github.com/ReSearchITEng/kubeadm-playbook) so passing charts to configure the cluster makes things more automated.

Packaged charts will be in repo [ghormoon/helm-charts](https://github.com/ghormoon/helm-charts) available to be used by helm directly from [ghormoon.github.io/helm-charts](https://ghormoon.github.io/helm-charts/).

## openebs-zfs-storageclasses

To be deployed into the same namespace as [openebs/zfs-localpv](https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv).
